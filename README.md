# Build my own Socket Programmings.

This project is an implementation of a basic FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server and client using Python sockets. Itâ€™s built as an assignment for the Computer Network subject, demonstrating the fundamental FTP commands for file transfer between a client and server over a network. You can connect to the FTP server using clients like FileZilla to test the functionality.
